 * @brief The MarcRestClient class - Abstraction layer between FUSE API and Mail.ru Cloud API.
 *
 * This class is used in an object pool to perform various lookups/calls to Mail.ru cloud.
 * It operates via cURL calls to specified endpoints. There is no public Cloud docs exposed
 * so all calls here are reverse-engineered from browser-to-cloud interaction.
 *
 * cURL connects via HTTPS protocol, so uses libcrypto PKIX. This means that there are
 * engine initialization, handshake, keys and other memory-pressing entities created
 * as a result of exchange. Valgrind may report false-positives for calls from here
 * that appear because libcrypto initializes its engine partially on garbage heap data.
